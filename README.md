# Game Design Portfolio

Welcome to my game design portfolio! This repository showcases my work from the University of Washington Game Design certificate course.

## 📚 About This Repository

I'm documenting my journey in game design, which includes:
- **Academic & Conceptual Projects**: Design theory, game mechanics analysis, and conceptual work
- **Playable Games**: Fully implemented game prototypes and complete games

This repository serves as both a portfolio and a learning archive, tracking my progress from conceptual designs to playable experiences.
